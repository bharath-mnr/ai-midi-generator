# üéπ MIDI AI Studio

> AI-powered music composition platform with professional MIDI generation, editing, and style learning capabilities.

## ‚ú® Features

 **üí° Workflow Revolution:** This AI can accomplish in minutes what would traditionally take a skilled musician 10+ years of piano study and music theory mastery to achieve. If you have strong theoretical knowledge but lack instrumental proficiency, this tool bridges that gap instantly.
 
- **AI Music Generation**: Create professional MIDI compositions from text descriptions
- **Reference Style Learning**: Upload MIDI files to teach AI your preferred musical style
- **MIDI Editing**: Upload and edit existing MIDI files with AI assistance
- **Text ‚Üî MIDI Conversion**: Bidirectional conversion between text notation and MIDI
- **Professional Output**: Support for 1-200 bars with sophisticated harmony and dynamics
- **Real-time Preview**: View MIDI notation before downloading


## üé® Example: Orchestral Harmony Enhancement

### Original MIDI (Before)
![Original MIDI](images/before-midi.png)
*Simple melody line (33 bars)*

### AI-Enhanced Result (After)
![Enhanced MIDI](images/after-midi.png)
*Full orchestral arrangement with 5-part harmony*

**Prompt Used:**
Keep the main melody fully intact and positioned in the high register.
Do not alter or revoice the melody in any way ‚Äî it remains exactly as written.
Add rich orchestral harmony layers beneath the melody, forming at least
5-part harmony for a full ensemble texture.
Maintain smooth voice leading and overall orchestral balance, ensuring
a deep, lush harmonic texture throughout.
Keep the total structure exactly 33 bars.
Use cinematic or symphonic voicing principles:

High range (D4‚ÄìA6): Melody remains clear and dominant.
Upper-mid range (G3‚ÄìG5): Light harmonic or supportive lines.
Middle range (C3‚ÄìC5): Core harmonic foundation and color tones.
Lower range (C2‚ÄìC4): Deep harmonic reinforcement and root tones.
Sub-low range (E1‚ÄìC3): Optional octave or bass grounding.

Keep the harmony openly spaced in lower registers and closer in upper
registers for natural cinematic warmth.
Preserve the melody as the clear focal point, while the underlying
harmony moves slowly, legato, and dynamically supportive, never
rhythmically intrusive.
The final sound should be lush, emotive, and fully cinematic, maintaining
clarity, warmth, and melodic dominance across all 33 bars.

**Result:** The AI successfully added cinematic harmonic layers across 5 voices 
while preserving the original melody's position and character, creating a 
professional orchestral arrangement.

## üéµ MIDI Text Notation Format

The application uses a custom text-based MIDI notation:

```
Tempo: 120
TimeSig: 4/4
Key: C

Bar: 1
C4:   X . . .   X60 . . .   . . X80 .   . . . X
E4:   . X . .   . . X . .   X . . .   . X . .
G4:   . . X .   . . . X .   . X . .   . . X .
```

### Symbols
- `X` = Note (velocity 100)
- `X[1-127]` = Note with specific velocity
- `.` = Rest
- `~` = Sustain
- `XR[n]` = Right offset (delayed start)
- `XE[n]` = Early cutoff (shortened duration)

## üéπ Usage Examples

### Generate Music from Description
```
Compose a 16-bar piano piece in C major with emotional melody, 
rich harmonies, and dynamic crescendos
```

### Edit Existing MIDI
1. Upload MIDI file
2. Describe changes: "Add bass line and make it more dramatic"
3. Download enhanced version

### Use Reference Files
1. Upload 2-3 MIDI files in your preferred style
2. Generate new compositions matching that style
3. AI learns tempo, harmony, and rhythmic patterns

## üîß Configuration

### Time Signatures Supported
- 4/4, 3/4, 2/4 (Standard)
- 6/8, 12/8 (Compound)

### Composition Length
- Minimum: 1 bar
- Maximum: 200 bars
- Optimal quality: 16-48 bars

### Performance Modes
- **Fast**: Quick generation (16 bars default)
- **Balanced**: Quality/speed balance (32 bars)
- **Quality**: Best results (48 bars)
